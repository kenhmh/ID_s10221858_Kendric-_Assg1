Project is about creating a website fot a singer ( Justin bieber). As i am a fan and love his song , I wanted to create for him a website  which showcase clearly his songs and merch.I 



# Design process
As the target audience for this website are mainly fans of justin biber specially children to young adults. I want to create a website which can cater to all sorts of ages. I also want design a website which is cater and promote clearly the latest album releases by the artist.Since during this time people will mostly buy the current merch and album, thus  the merch section of the website will plainly promote the lastest 'justice' album rather than promoting all song ( old song) as a whole  I am thinking of firstly just creating a simple and plain website first without adding much design and detail first  and make sure that my website will have a strong base first. Before moving on to the design and detial of each panel / pages .
The website will be more cater to selling the merch as since viewing songs/ album will be mostly done on other platform such as youtube or any music streaming servive. Thus there will be a bigger section on the merch than the album itself. Instead of having the main page / shop/ album together. I am planning on seperating eah section in different website pages for ease of access to a particular thing the user will want to look at

As a user type , I will like a easy naviagable page in order to explore this album/ songs but most importantly his merch. In order for me to view and potentially buying this products(merch)


# Features
Easy navigation between pages
 
 
 # Technologies Used
 - visual studio code( didnt used as much compare to repilt but i need to improve and get more used to using this as it is a industry standard)
 - adobe XD ( to create a wireframe to how my website will potentially look like, the XD version might be different then the final website due to feedback and changes)
 - w3schools website ( relies on this a lot as despite pratices done I still needed referance and guide in using some html,css language)
